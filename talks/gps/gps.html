						We often want to model a function - say, an image, or a time series - where we might not be able to specify some functional form in advance, but rather only very general properties, such a a rough amplitude and length scale.

					<section>
						When we interpolate, we are performing a <i>regression</i> analysis, trying to fit a function to data. This is the same problem as extrapolation, where we are predicting the value of this function a long way from the samples on which it is conditioned.

					<section>
						Go to a GP - a Gaussian Process!
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>A Gaussian Process is a <b>distribution over functions</b> such that any <b>finite set </b> of samples are <b>jointly Gaussian-distributed.</b></p>
						<p class="fragment">These are sometimes also referred to as <b>Gaussian random fields.</b></p>
					</section>

					<section>
						\[
						\underbrace{\mathbf{y}}_{\text{data}} \sim \mathscr{N}(\overbrace{\mu}^{\text{mean}},\underbrace{\mathbf{K}}_{\text{covariance}})
						\]	
					</section>

					<section>
						These are good for regression where you have some idea of the shape of a function, and crucially, give you estimates of the uncertainty in your predictions as well.
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>You specify a  mean function \[\mu(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\theta}_\mu) \] which defines a deterministic, parametric model (e.g. the orbit of a planet)...</p>
						<p class="fragment">and a covariance function \[\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x_2}, \mathbf{\theta}_K) \] which generates random variations, such as stellar activity.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>In general you will want your covariance function to simply be a 'kernel' \[\mathbf{K}(x_1,x_2) = k(|\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2|, \mathbf{\theta}_K) \]</p>
						<p class="fragment"> which we see depends only on the distance between your input data. </p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Any zero-mean GP/Gaussian Random Field is fully characterized by its power spectral density (PSD), or equivalently, its covariance function. </p>
						<p class="fragment">These are interchangeable because of the Wiener-Khinchine theorem, which states that these are related by a Fourier transform. </p>
						<p class="fragment">
							\[ 
							\underbrace{f\star f}_{\text{autocorrelation}} = FT(|f|^2) 
							\]
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>These can be simple 1D functions, like here where \(k(\Delta t) = \exp(-{\Delta t}/\tau)^2 \)</p>
						<img class="fragment" width='450' height = '450' data-src='1dtest.jpg' alt='1d'>
					</section>

					<section>
						... or these can have higher dimensions. For example, the <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/kolmo.htm">Kolmogorov theory of turbulence</a> has a self-similar, power-law power spectral density in wavenumber \(k\)<br><br>
						\[ E(k) \propto  k^{-5/3} \]

						<h1>History</h1>
					</section>

					<section>
					Danish astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorvald_N._Thiele">Thorvald Thiele</a> was the first to my knowledge to use something like a GP, discovering what was later called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter">Kalman Filter</a>, a special case of the GP.
					</section>

					<section>
						GP filtering was rediscovered in similar but different forms by American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a> in the context of controlling anti-aircraft guns in World War II, and contemporaneously by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov">Andrey Kolmogorov</a> in the Soviet Union. This inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_E._K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n">Rudolf E. Kálmán</a> to develop the Kalman filter for missile guidance in the Cold War.
					</section>

					<section>
						<a href="http://econgeol.geoscienceworld.org/content/58/8/1246">Matheron</a> defined 'kriging' (after pioneering miner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danie_G._Krige">Danie Krige</a>) as a technique in geospatial statistics 'computing the weighted average of available samples... The suitable weights \(a_i\) are determined by \(\sum_i a_i = 1 \)... [and the prediction] variance... should take the smallest possible value'.
					</section>

					<section>
						The idea was that if it is expensive to take exploratory samples, you should have some optimal interpolating method that knows about the spatial structure of an ore body to help you make the best inference about where to mine.
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>This has also been used in meteorology, to interpolate between a few weather stations across a wide region (eg Switzerland below)</p>
						<img class="fragment" width='400' height='318' data-src='kriging_weather.jpg' alt='http://www.gitta.info/ContiSpatVar/en/html/Interpolatio_learningObject3.xhtml'> 
					</section>

					<section>
						GPs are now ubiquitously used in machine learning: 'Bayesian neural networks with infinitely many hidden units converge to Gaussian processes with a particular kernel (covariance) function' (from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02222">here</a> and <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387947242">here</a>). Serious machine learning people are trying to combine the smoothness and power of GPs with the flexibility of neural networks - this is a hot topic! 
					</section>

					<section data-background="./kolmogorov.jpg">
					<h2>So how does it work?</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<img width='500' height='384' data-src="covariance.jpg" alt="How Covariance Works">
						<p class="fragment">Information about \(x_1\) tells you more about \(x_2\) than just the marginal distribution - because they are correlated, learning \(x_1\) allows you to predict \(x_2\) more accurately.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>In using a GP we exploit this by knowing the correlations across, say, a whole time series or spatial map.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>This is characterized by a covariance matrix like this, for squared exponential correlation with \(\lambda = 100\).</p>
						<img class="fragment" width='500' height='500' data-src='covariance_matrix.jpg' style="border:none; box-shadow:none" alt="Matrix">
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Remarkably, the posterior for a GP conditioned upon data \(\mathbf{x}_* \) is also a GP, and has an analytic distribution</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							 \[ p(\mathbf{y}*) = \mathscr{N}(\mathbf{m}_*, \mathbf{C}_*),\]
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							where \[ \mathbf{m}_* = \mathbf{\mu}(\mathbf{x}_*) + \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}_*, \mathbf{x})\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x})^{-1} (\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{\mu}(\mathbf{x}))
							\]
						</p>
						<p class="fragment"> 
							and <br>
							\[ \mathbf{C}_* = \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}_*,\mathbf{x}_*) -\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}_*,\mathbf{x})\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})^{-1}\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}_*,\mathbf{x})^T.
 							\]
						</p>
					</section>

										<section>
						<p>Your kernel can be thought of as matching the impulse response function of a linear system. So for a driven, damped harmonic oscillator, the kernel is</p>
						<p class="fragment">
						\[ k(\Delta t) = A_0 \cdot \exp{(-\dfrac{\Delta t}{\tau})} \cos(\omega \Delta t)
						\]
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">Let's look at some draws from this distribution.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<img width='450' height='450' data-src="sho_kernel.jpg" style="border:none; box-shadow:none" alt="SHO Kernel">
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>There are many kernels for different tasks, and I will not cover them all here. For example, there is the Matern-3/2 kernel</p>
						<p class="fragment">\[k(r^2) = (1+\sqrt{3r^2}) \exp(-\sqrt{3} r^2)
						\]</p>
						<p class="fragment"> which is good for rough or jagged processes.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Or there is the Exponential Sine Squared kernel</p>
						<p class="fragment">\[k(x_i,x_j) = \exp(-\Gamma \sin^2{(\dfrac{\pi}{P} |x_j - x_i|)})\]</p>
						<p class="fragment"> which is good for periodic processes which 'lose memory' at a rate determined by \(\Gamma\).</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						Choosing the kernel is often as much an art as a science - while it should ideally match the dynamics of the system, in practice these are often not well known, and a combination of experimentation and intuition is required.
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Often you will want to represent white noise as a diagonal term in your covariance matrix, so that</p>
						<p class="fragment">\[\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{K}_0 + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}.  \]</p>
						<p class="fragment">This white noise parameter \(\sigma\) allows you to account for uncorrelated errors safely.</p>
					</section>


					<section>
						<h2>Hyperparameters</h2>
					</section>


					<section>
						<p>The parameters \( \tau, P, \Gamma, \nu\) et cetera above are called <i>hyperparameters.</i></p>
						<p class="fragment"> While GPs are non-parametric models, the general information such as length scale, period, amplitude and so forth that controls a GP is determined by these hyperparameters. In general, you will want to optimize these to get the best possible fit to your data.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Conveniently, the GP has an analytic marginal likelihood!</i></p>
						<p class="fragment"> \[ \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\theta},I) = -\underbrace{\dfrac{1}{2} \mathbf{y}^T (\mathbf{K}+\sigma^2 \mathbf{I})^{-1} \mathbf{y}}_{\text{data fit}}\]</p>
						<p class="fragment">\[-\underbrace{\dfrac{1}{2} \log(\det(\mathbf{K}+\sigma^2 \mathbf{I}))}_{\text{complexity penalty}}
						- \underbrace{\dfrac{n}{2}\log(2\pi)}_{\text{constant}}\]
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						You will usually use an optimizing library such as <a href="scipy.optimize.minimize">scipy</a> to maximize the likelihood of this GP fit and therefore optimize the hyperparameters - you uually don't care as much about their detailed distribution.
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>In practice the determinant and matrix inversion are what kills you, as these scale as \( \mathscr{O}(3)\) with the number of data points \( n\) - brutal! </p>
						<p class="fragment">It is very often the case that most of the ingenuity in a GP software package is in implementing a clever matrix decomposition such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6015">HODLR</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition">Cholesky</a> decompositions, which are beyond my mortal ken.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						In your work you should rarely need to use these! There are excellent GP packages available, such as <a href="http://dan.iel.fm/george/">george</a>, <a href="http://celerite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">celerite</a>, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href="http://www-ai.cs.uni-dortmund.de/weblab/static/api_docs/pyGPs/">pyGPs</a>, which are all fast and stable.

						<p>If you use a GP to try and fill in the gaps, you find there has been a bias to estimating lower global warming than previously thought.</p>
