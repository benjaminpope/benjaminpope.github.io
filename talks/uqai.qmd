## Optics as analogy to neural networks {background-image="./images/pleiades.jpg"}

-  Optical systems are made of layers
-  Each layer is a global linear transformation (propagation) 
    - or elementwise operation (eg a mask)

## dLux - Differentiable Optical Models in Jax 

![](./images/dlux.jpeg)

Define an optical system just like a neural network:

```{.python}

optical_layers = [
    dl.CreateWavefront    (wf_npix, aperture),
    dl.TiltWavefront      (),
    dl.CircularAperture   (wf_npix),
    dl.NormaliseWavefront (),
    dl.PhysicalMFT        (det_npix, fl, det_pixsize)]

```

## Examples {background-image="./images/monet.jpg"}

With [Louis Desdoigts](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts) we have been working on a few examples: see the [docs](https://louisdesdoigts.github.io/dLux/)!

::: {.incremental}
- HMC for simultaneous phase retrieval and deconvolution
- Designing toward an optimal Fisher Information Matrix
