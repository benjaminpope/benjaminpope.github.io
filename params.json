{"name":"Benjamin Pope","tagline":"GitHub Homepage","body":"### My Science\r\nI study exoplanets, planets around other stars, and develop new and better methods for detecting and characterizing them. My main focus at the moment is the Kepler-2 (K2) mission, applying Gaussian processes and other Bayesian methods to correct for systematics in studies of exoplanets and stellar physics.\r\n\r\nI'm also pursuing applications of aperture masking and kernel phase interferometry with extreme adaptive optics and integral field spectrographs. These permit spatially-resolved detections of faint companions to stars and simultaneous extraction of their spectra, with interferometry providing a boost to spatial resolution, contrast limits, and speckle calibration. I am also interested in wavefront sensing and adaptive optics, Bayesian methods, and photonic devices.\r\n\r\n### This Page\r\nOn this page I'll link to and discuss some of the code I've been developing for these science applications ","google":"UA-40227049-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
