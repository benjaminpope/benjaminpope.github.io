{"name":"Benjamin Pope","tagline":"GitHub Homepage","body":"# About Me\r\nI'm an Australian-born astronomer, Bayesian and foodie DPhil student at the University of Oxford. My main academic page is [here](www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~popeb/), and this site is about my code repos. \r\n\r\n###Kernel Phase Inteferometry\r\nMy main repository for kernel phase interferometry work can be found [here](https://github.com/benjaminpope/whisky). This is a cool new adaptive optics / space telescope image processing technique, which allows you to enhance detail at ~ the diffraction limit, by calibrating out phase errors from residual optical aberrations. (This is a generalization of the idea of closure phases to pupils without a mask, so long as the phase errors aren't too bad).\r\n\r\nKernel phase so far has been a solution looking for a problem - so if you have an application in mind, please do fork the repo or email me with your questions!\r\n\r\n### My Science\r\nI study exoplanets, planets around other stars, and develop new and better methods for detecting and characterizing them. My main focus at the moment is the Kepler-2 (K2) mission, applying Gaussian processes and other Bayesian methods to correct for systematics in studies of exoplanets and stellar physics.\r\n\r\nI'm also pursuing applications of aperture masking and kernel phase interferometry with extreme adaptive optics and integral field spectrographs. These permit spatially-resolved detections of faint companions to stars and simultaneous extraction of their spectra, with interferometry providing a boost to spatial resolution, contrast limits, and speckle calibration. I am also interested in wavefront sensing and adaptive optics, Bayesian methods, and photonic devices.","google":"UA-40227049-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
