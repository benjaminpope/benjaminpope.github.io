>>>>>>> 7133e537b330b5a91a014b7d9a4f85c2cf5f2acd

<p>I'm an Australian-born astronomer, Bayesian and foodie DPhil student at the University of Oxford. My main academic page is <a href="www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/%7Epopeb/">here</a>, and this site is about my code repos. </p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>In particular, I'm interested in light curves of very bright stars (Kepler magnitude < 8), which are saturated and typically not observed conventionally in Kepler or K2. <a href="arxiv.org/abs/1510.00008">Using collateral data</a> it is possible to recover light curves of bright stars that were never conventionally observed, whose photometry is still encoded in the 'smear' bias the cause in their column. This is not a weird effect! It is a common feature of any CCD camera without a shutter: </p>

<p>All the code used to develop this is available on GitHub <a href="http://github.com/benjaminpope/keplersmear/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am also interested in using the scattered light halo of bright stars to obtain light curves. This project is in collaboration with <a href="http://github.com/hvidy">Tim White</a> (Aarhus) and will soon be open source <a href="http://github.com/hvidy/halophot">here</a>.</p>


<h3><a id="kernel" class="anchor" href="#kernel" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kernel Phase</h3>


<p>I'm also pursuing applications of aperture masking and kernel phase interferometry with extreme adaptive optics and integral field spectrographs. These permit spatially-resolved detections of faint companions to stars and simultaneous extraction of their spectra, with interferometry providing a boost to spatial resolution, contrast limits, and speckle calibration. I am also interested in wavefront sensing and adaptive optics, Bayesian methods, and photonic devices.</p>

<p>My main repository for kernel phase interferometry work can be found <a href="https://github.com/benjaminpope/whisky">here</a>. This is a cool new adaptive optics / space telescope image processing technique, which allows you to enhance detail at ~ the diffraction limit, by calibrating out phase errors from residual optical aberrations. (This is a generalization of the idea of closure phases to pupils without a mask, so long as the phase errors aren't too bad).</p>

<p>Kernel phase so far has been a solution looking for a problem - so if you have an application in mind, please do fork the repo or email me with your questions!</p>

<a id="my-science" class="anchor" href="#my-science" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Science</h3>

<p>I study exoplanets, planets around other stars, and develop new and better methods for detecting and characterizing them. My main focus at the moment is the Kepler-2 (K2) mission, applying Gaussian processes and other Bayesian methods to correct for systematics in studies of exoplanets and stellar physics.</p>
